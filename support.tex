\section{Sage Funding}

\noindent{}This is a list of financial support that the PI has
managed  as director of the Sage project.

\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0ex}

\item \$30,000 (2008) -- Microsoft Corporation, unrestricted gift to UW.  Used to fund
partial port of Sage to Microsoft Windows.
\item \$18,500 (2008) -- Google, unrestricted gift to UW.  Used to fully fund six
  UW student projects during Summer 2008.
\item \$144,543 (2007--2010) -- National Science Foundation Grant No. 0713225. 
  The Sage Postdoc, which is a 3-year postdoc at UW.
\item \$5,000 (2007) -- Trophees du Libre. Sage won first prize in the
  scientific category of Trophees du Libre.
\item \$12,000 approx. (2007--2008) -- private donations from about 10 people to UW
  to support the Sage project.
\item \$106,869 (2008) -- National Science Foundation Grant
  No. 0821725. Paid for the purchase of a very high end cluster of
  machines at UW that is used by the Sage project (and many other
  projects).
\item \$43,000 (2008) -- Contract with the Center for Communications
  Research, Princeton.  The PI received a 50\% teaching buyout in
  exchange for development work on Sage.
\end{itemize}

\section{Other Funding}
\noindent{}I have also received other financial support from the National Science
Foundation for my work in pure mathematics (number theory) that is not
listed above, because this is distinct from the Sage project.  This
includes NSF grants 0757627, 0653968, 0729340, 0555776, and 0400386.

\section{Justification for Further Funding}
The Sage project has thrived under the PI's leadership to a
large extent because he has had a teaching reduction during his first
three years at UW (in 2006--2007 as part of his job offer, in
2007--2009 via funded teaching buyout).  If this RRF is not awarded,
2009--2010 will be the first year in which the PI will have to
simultaneously direct the Sage project and have a 100\% teaching load.
%As the above funding shows, there are benefits to UW if the Sage
%project is given the opportunity to continue to thrive.
